# 🚀 Placement Agent

This repository contains draft implementations and experimental iterations of building an **AI Agent for placement preparation**.

It includes sample code demonstrating how to build and run AI agents locally using:

- 🐍 Python  
- 🔗 LangChain  
- 🦙 Ollama (local LLM execution)  
- 📄 ReportLab (PDF generation)  
- 🌐 Tavily (web search integration)

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a **reference and experimentation playground** for building custom AI agents.
